•	You need Node.js (v6 and above) and npm installed on your machine. 
You also need to install yarn since that’s what create-react-app uses.

npm install -g yarn

•	Install create-react-app by running the following command in your terminal:

    npm install -g create-react-app
    
•	Then create your React app with the following command:

    create-react-app ReactTesting-app
    
  •	Once the application has been created, cd into the ReactTesting-app directory and run yarn start to launch the development server. 

  cd ReactTesting-app
  yarn start

 yarn test


 yarn add enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 --dev


 yarn add react-test-renderer –dev
